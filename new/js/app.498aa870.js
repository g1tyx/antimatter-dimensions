You're f*cking dead,\n      kiddo."},{id:"a113",text:"So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's a\n      game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension\n      provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too\n      plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the\n      fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just\n      thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that\n      add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You\n      start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep\n      going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to\n      infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very\n      large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming\n      infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your\n      happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you\n      go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your\n      life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know\n      what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give\n      you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car\n      being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities'\n      are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with\n      seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional\n      Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is\n      new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had.\n      'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy.\n      Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness."},{id:"a114",text:"(Make me sleep) Put me to sleep inside.

Our greatest responsibility is to serve our antimatter communities.\n      We are extremely proud of the quantity, unbalanced journalism that ANN news produces. But we're\n      concerned about the troubling trend of responsible, two-sided news stories plaguing the antimatter\n      universe. The sharing of unbiased and true news has become all too common on social media. More\n      alarmingly, some media outlets publish these same true stories, stories that aren't just propaganda,\n      without checking government talking points first. Unfortunately, some members of the media use their\n      platforms to push a logically sound opinion and unbiased agenda to diversify 'exactly what antimatter\n      thinks'.

An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is\n      held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that's useful because that's the only part that\n      matters; however, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and\n      tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that's useful or\n      important, so don't worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would\n      look like this: /¯\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to\n      finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that\n      total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this Eternity in isolation then yes, it would be\n      three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run,\n      such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well,\n      then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the\n      three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in\n      three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only\n      required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M\n      presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this\n      phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you'd round up that up to three, but in\n      a full game run, you'd round it down to two. So, in conclusion, since that first M press counts in other\n      contexts, but adds no additional presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a \"Half M Press\"."},{id:"a260",text:"It seems that the Replicanti have a very divide-and-conquer method of doing things.\n      Well, everything at this rate."},{id:"a261",text:"Antimatter Dimensions is actually a Roguelite game!

Stage 2, the unveiling of the EMOF (Empire Mechanical Obliteration Forcefield) had over 50\n      dignitaries - multiple emperors (from federated states to organisational leaders), foreign rulers, EMDF\n      (Effluent Manifested Destiny Families) who currently own the land, and even some of the forecast witches,\n      all gathered together to unveil the project in a show of EOSF (Empire Official Solidarity Friendships).\n      Sadly, the project was eventually cancelled at stage 215, as the creation of the EMTF (Excrement Material\n      Transmutation Facility) for the contractors exploded after coming into contact with a SMEA (Small-Medium\n      Electric Airship) placing the last survey peg from stage 459 due to a time vortex created by an argument\n      at the WAIC (Witches Annual Infrastructure Committee) as part of stage 56. Truly, tragic stuff - 3 award\n      nominations and 2 wins during that process due to EBIF (Efficient Bureaucracy In (the) Field)."},{id:"l1",text:"You just made your 1,000,000,000,000,000th antimatter.

This means that clearing your browser's cache or cookies, or fully\nuninstalling the game from Steam will also delete your save file.\nSimilarly, if you are playing in a private or incognito window, your save\nwon't be there the next time you open up your browser. The saves are browser-specific as well, so for example\nif you play the game on Chrome, you won't find your save on Firefox. Lastly, any saves you have on the web version and\nthe Steam version will also be completely independent from each other.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can transfer your save between places by using the export function, which will copy a <i>very</i> long string of\nrandom-looking characters into your clipboard. That text contains your save data, which you can load back into the\ngame by pasting it into the text box on the import prompt. You need the entirety of the save text for importing to\nwork properly, or else the game might not recognize the text as a valid save. Certain messaging applications may\ncut off part of the text if you are using one to transfer the save between devices.\n<br>\n<br>\nA properly-formatted save string from the Reality update will start with\n<b>${GameSaveSerializer.startingString.savefile}</b> and end with <b>${GameSaveSerializer.endingString.savefile}</b>.\nIf you are importing from a version of the game from before Reality was released, it will instead start with <b>eyJ</b>\nand end with <b>In19</b>, <b>fX0=</b>, or <b>fQ==</b>. If neither of these are the case, then part of your save is\nmissing and it will fail to import. In addition to importing and exporting to your clipboard, you can also import\nand export from text files as well.\n<br>\nYou can use the "Choose save" button to pick between three separate saves on your browser. These saves are, for most\nintents and purposes, completely separate from each other. Importing and exporting will only affect the current save\nslot. <b>The only exception is clearing your browser or Steam data, in which case all three saves will be reset.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe game automatically saves periodically, by default once every ${formatInt(30)} seconds, and it will notify you in\nthe top-right corner of the screen whenever it saves. Keep this in mind if you need to close the game - anything you\ndo right before closing it might not be saved unless you wait for the autosave interval or manually save again. The\nlength of the autosave interval is adjustable.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can also connect a Google Account to the game, allowing you to save your progress online. This allows you to play\nwith the same save on any device which is also logged into the same account. Cloud saving is only compatable with other\nsaves on the web or Steam versions of the game; saves from the Android app of the game won't be automatically linked via\nCloud saving. Saving and loading from the Cloud will\nautomatically overwrite the other save unless the other save is either older or has noticeably more progression, in\nwhich case a modal will appear which asks you which save you want to keep.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can completely reset your save at any point if desired by clicking the button, which brings up a prompt you need\nto fill out in order to make sure you intentionally wanted to reset. Going through with this reset will only clear\nyour current save; the other save slots will be unaffected. <b>Resetting your game in this way is completely\nirreversible and gives you no permanent benefits, secret or otherwise.</b>\n`,isUnlocked:()=>!0,tags:["choose","cloud","google","save","import","export","reset"],tab:"options/saving"},{name:"Customization",info:()=>`\nThe game has two different UI layouts - the Classic UI maintains the style of Antimatter Dimensions from before the\nReality update, while the Modern UI is a redesign based on more modern dark theme styles.

There are a few secret themes\nwhich can be unlocked through importing certain phrases. Both UI layouts support all the different possible themes.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe notation used to display numbers in the game defaults to Mixed Scientific, but can be changed to one of numerous\noptions in the drop-down menu. Many of these notations are intended as jokes and in some cases will format numbers\nin a way that causes text to spill over into other parts of the screen - this is not a bug. "Exponent formatting" is\na setting affecting some notations which lets you toggle between showing the number in an exponent itself (with commas\nevery three digits) or also applying the notation formatting to the exponent.

You can store\n"game time" by charging your Black Hole, and you can store "real time" by intentionally halting your production.\nStored game time is also used as a currency for purchasing unlocks from The Nameless Ones.\n<br>\n<br>\nCharging your Black Hole gives you stored game time, which it does at the expense of setting your game speed to\n${formatInt(1)}. The game is in effect using your increased game speed in order to store game time itself. Its\nmain use is to discharge the Black Hole, which takes uses your stored game time to skip forward in time by a duration\nequal to the game time stored. This is different than regular game speed multipliers in that discharging is not subject\nto any modifiers to game speed when it is used, only when it is stored.\n<br>\n<br>\nStoring real time completely stops all production, effectively pausing your game. For every real-time second that\npasses, you gain stored real time (modified by some efficiency factor). You can use stored real time in order to\namplify a Reality in the Glyphs tab. When you complete the Reality, this uses all of your stored real time at once\nin order to attempt to repeat that\nexact Reality over and over, giving you all the rewards you would normally get from the repetitions. For example, if\nyou have ${formatInt(50)} minutes stored and amplify a Reality which has lasted ${formatInt(10)} minutes and would\ngive ${format(f.E30)} RM and ${format(f.E12)} Relic Shards, the amplified Reality will give you ${format(5e30)} RM,\n${format(5e12)} Relic Shards, ${formatInt(5)} Glyphs (subject to your filtering settings),\nand ${formatInt(5)} Perk Points.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, if your Reality has lasted for less than ${formatInt(1)} second, the amplification factor is capped by the\namount of seconds stored.
